INTRODUCTION

This project implements a blocking queue using pthreads, a synchronization mechanism in C. A blocking queue is a thread-safe data structure where threads can safely enqueue and dequeue elements. If the queue is full, the enqueue operation blocks until space becomes available, and if the queue is empty, the dequeue operation blocks until new elements are added.
