SortedSet Class

The `SortedSet` class provides a data structure that maintains elements in a sorted order and prevents duplicate entries. It is implemented in C and uses a custom `Vector` as its underlying storage mechanism.

## Features
- **Sorted Insertion:** Elements are inserted in a sorted order based on a user-provided comparison function.
- **No Duplicates:** Duplicate elements are not allowed, ensuring that the set contains unique elements.
- **Custom Comparison and Cleanup:** Users can provide custom comparison and cleanup functions to manage element-specific behavior.
