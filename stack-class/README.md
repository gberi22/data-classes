These are two different implementations of a stack, demonstrating alternative approaches to stack design. Both serve the same purpose of managing elements in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner but differ in flexibility and complexity. The first implementation supports variable-sized elements by incorporating metadata with each element, making it more versatile but complex. The second implementation, on the other hand, is designed for fixed-size elements, offering a simpler and more efficient approach suitable for many standard use cases. Together, they showcase two distinct ways to implement the same fundamental data structure.
